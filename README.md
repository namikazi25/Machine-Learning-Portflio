### Code for Demystifying Black-box Learning Models of Rumor Detection from Social Media Posts

This directory contains various models and techniques used for the task of rumor detection from social media posts. The models include:

- SVM, XGBoost, Decision Tree Classifier, Extra Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Hybrid Ensemble Model consisting of 25 instances of 5 different models with 5 instances from each model with different parameters

The datasets used for these models are from the “Constraint@AAAI2021 - COVID19 Fake News Detection” competition and publicly available Twitter15 and Twitter16 datasets.

### Keras Tuner Image Classification with CIFAR-10

This directory contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset using the Keras Tuner library.

### Image Classifications with VGG and ResNet on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and STL-10

This directory contains six Jupyter notebooks implementing VGG and ResNet architectures for image classification tasks on three different datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and STL-10. The notebooks are:

1. CW3 Mini Project ResNet on CIFAR-10.ipynb
2. CW3 Mini Project ResNet on MNIST.ipynb
3. CW3 Mini Project ResNet on STL-10.ipynb
4. CW3 Mini Project VGG on CIFAR-10.ipynb
5. CW3 Mini Project VGG on MNIST.ipynb
6. CW3 Mini Project VGG on STL-10.ipynb

## Instructions

Python versions of 3.x are supported. To install the necessary libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
